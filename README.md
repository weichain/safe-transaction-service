# Gnosis Transaction Service

Keeps track of transactions sent via Gnosis Safe contracts. It uses events and
[tracing](https://openethereum.github.io/JSONRPC-trace-module) to index the txs.

Transactions are detected in an automatic way, so there is no need of informing the service about the transactions
as in previous versions of the _Transaction Service_.

Transactions can also be sent to the service to allow offchain collecting of signatures or informing the owners about
a transaction that is pending to be sent to the blockchain.

## Service infrastructure

Here is a diagram showing us how the services work
![services architecture](<https://134244847-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MhyEZtd5TVytPJtyS7v-2910905616%2Fuploads%2Fgit-blob-bb8415e262a22ae903604c834d5655e8f32617fc%2FArchitecture%20docs%20diagrams(4).png?alt=media>)

## Setting up Safe Transaction Service

Transaction Service is mostly setup, in future if there are some changes to the RPC url, you can change that in .env.
When deploying to production we would have to add the mainnet to setup_service.py, you can find it in safe_transaction_service/history/management/commands , best practice for this is to create a PR in this service for the guys from Gnosis to add our network if not, we could add it manually. You would just have to add the chainId and the GnosisSafeProxyFactory and GnosisSafeL2 and the blocks that they are deployed at(for optimization purposes) you can find those addresses from [this](https://docs.avax.network/subnets/deploy-a-gnosis-safe-on-your-evm#deploy-the-safe-contracts) step which you should have done beforehand.

The required steps to run the service
rename `.env.example` to `.env`

```
docker-compose build --force-rm
docker-compose up
```

You can now look around at `http://localhost:8085`

You would need to create a superuser so that you could login in the admin panel

```
docker compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

```bash
# Inside the "safe-infrastructure/container_env_files/cfg.env"
CGW_FLUSH_TOKEN=some_random_token

# Inside the "safe-infrastructure/container_env_files/cgw.env"
WEBHOOK_TOKEN=some_random_token
```

if successful you should be able to login with the credentials in `http://localhost:8085/admin` in there navigate to `Web hooks` on the left side of the navigation panel. Click Add Web Hook

- Ignore the `Address` field
- Set the `url` field to `http://nginx:8000/cgw/v1/chains/43214913/hooks/events` Note: this is one of the issues we've encountered while working on the services, the transaction service is not recognizing this url, usually what we've done is deploy the safe-infrastructure to a public network using ngrok again and just replace the url with the generated url from the ngrok. An example url is `https://c900-46-10-125-139.eu.ngrok.io/cgw/v1/43214913/hooks/events`. For more details about ngrok setup check below.
- Set the `Authorization` field to `Basic <WEBHOOK_TOKEN>`, where `<WEBHOOK_TOKEN>` corresponds to the value of `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` in the `container_env_files/cgw.env` file of this repository

## Setup for development

Use a virtualenv if possible:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Then enter the virtualenv and install the dependencies:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install -f
cp .env.dev .env
./run_tests.sh
```

## Setup for development using docker

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

## Setup for production (event indexing)

Since **version 3.0.0** transaction service can be configured to rely on **event indexing**
when [SafeL2 version](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/blob/v1.3.0/contracts/GnosisSafeL2.sol) is used. **Only
contracts from v1.3.0 onwards with L2 events will be indexed.**

An example environment file can be used for the L2 setup:

```bash
cp .env.l2.sample .env
```

Edit `.env` file to add `ETHEREUM_NODE_URL` (on the example a `Polygon` public node is used)
and remember to modify `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` to **use a strong key**. The rest of the
configuration does not need to be modified. Then:

```bash
docker-compose build --force-rm
docker-compose up
```

If the network is not supported yet [contracts can be deployed using the deployment instructions
](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts/tree/v1.3.0/contracts)
and then a PR should be provided to this service [adding the deployment block number and the address (address
will be the same for every network)](safe_transaction_service/history/management/commands/setup_service.py). Only
`ProxyFactory` and `GnosisSafeL2` must be configured. `+L2` must be added to the Safe contract versions, so the service
knows the contract can be indexed using events.

For more parameters check [base.py](config/settings/base.py) file.

## Setup for production (tracing mode)

This is the recommended configuration for running a production Transaction service. `docker-compose` is required
for running the project.

`bash cp .env.tracing.sample .env `

Configure the parameters needed on `.env`. These parameters **need to be changed**:

- `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`: Use a **strong key**.
- `ETHEREUM_NODE_URL`: Http/s address of a ethereum node. It can be the same than `ETHEREUM_TRACING_NODE_URL`.
- `ETHEREUM_TRACING_NODE_URL`: Http/s address of an OpenEthereum node with
  [tracing enabled](https://openethereum.github.io/JSONRPC-trace-module).

If you don't want to use `trace_filter` for the internal tx indexing and just rely on `trace_block`, set:

- `ETH_INTERNAL_NO_FILTER=1`

For more parameters check [base.py](config/settings/base.py) file.

Then:

```bash
docker-compose build --force-rm
docker-compose up
```

The service should be running in `localhost:8000`. You can test everything is set up:

```bash
curl 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1/about/'
```

You can go to http://localhost:5555/ to check the status of the task queue, also you can configure
[prometheus metrics](https://flower.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prometheus-integration.html).

For example, to set up a GÃ¶erli node:

Run an OpenEthereum node in your local computer:

```bash
openethereum --chain goerli --tracing on --db-path=/media/ethereum/openethereum --unsafe-expose
```

Edit `.env` so docker points to the host OpenEthereum node:

```
ETHEREUM_NODE_URL=http://172.17.0.1:8545
ETHEREUM_TRACING_NODE_URL=http://172.17.0.1:8545
```

Then:

```bash
docker-compose build --force-rm
docker-compose up
```

## Setup for private network

Instructions for production still apply, but some additional steps are required:

- Deploy the last version of the [Safe Contracts](https://github.com/gnosis/safe-contracts) on your private network.
- [Add their addresses and the number of the block they were deployed
  ](safe_transaction_service/history/management/commands/setup_service.py) (to optimize initial indexing).
  Service is currently configured to support _Mainnet_, _Rinkeby_, _Goerli_, _Kovan_, _xDai_, _Polygon_, _EWC_...
- If you have a custom `network id` you can change this line
  `ethereum_network = ethereum_client.get_network()` to `ethereum_network_id = ethereum_client.w3.net.version` and use
  the `network id` instead of the `Enum`.
- Only contracts that need to be configured are the **ProxyFactory** that will be used to deploy the contracts and
  the **GnosisSafe/GnosisSafeL2**.

## Use admin interface

Services come with a basic administration web ui (provided by Django) by default on http://localhost:8000/admin/

A user must be created to get access:

```bash
docker exec -it safe-transaction-service-web-1 python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Safe Contract ABIs and addresses

## Troubleshooting

### Issues installing grpc on a Mac M1

If you face issues installing the `grpc` dependency locally (required by this project) on a M1 chip, set `GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_OPENSSL=1` and `GRPC_PYTHON_BUILD_SYSTEM_ZLIB=1` and then try to install the dependency again.
